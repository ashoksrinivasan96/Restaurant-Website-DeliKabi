# Restaurant-Website-DeliKabi
One of the first few React website projects I will be taking on
This project is a take on restaurant websites and my version of a perfect portfolio for them.

## Motivation
I started out with a very basic idea of making a webisite for a restaurant owner. The progress was spread through weeks and turned out to be pretty challengeing.
It taught me several concepts as well as persevarance to actually close a project properly 😀
