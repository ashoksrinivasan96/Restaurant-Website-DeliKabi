# Restaurant-Website-DeliKabi
One of the first few React website projects I will be taking on.
This project is a take on restaurant websites and my version of a perfect portfolio for them.

## Motivation
I started out with a very basic idea of making a website for a restaurant owner. The progress was spread through weeks and turned out to be pretty challenging.
It taught me several concepts as well as perseverance to actually close a project properly ðŸ˜€
